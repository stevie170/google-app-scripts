# Google App Scripts

Google App Scripts is a platform that can be a powerful tool if you want to automate processes in Google Workspace (formerly G Suite for Business). It is also available in Google Drive for users who don't use Google Workspace.

>You write code in modern JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for favorite Google Workspace applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more. There's nothing to installâ€”we give you a code editor right in your browser, and your scripts run on Google's servers.

I recently had someone tell me she wanted to populate a Google Doc template with the submission from a Google Form, using an Add-on. However, she was restricted from installing Add-ons to her Google account based on HIPAA requirements. As I researched a workaround, I stumbled on Google App Scripts and dove in to find a solution for her specific problem. As I learned, I saw the potential for so many applications and projects for someone who uses Google tools heavily and wants  automated solutions.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:
* the scripts I wrote using learning tools
* the first script I wrote for use by the friend who asked for a specific solution
* a few more scripts I've written to automate forms for a therapy practice

I plan to add to this repository any additional Google App Scripts I write as the need arises.

## I am not a developer

I am completely self-taught when it comes to these scripting projects. I've done a few javascript tutorials, but mostly it's been learning as I go with this stuff. 

Hopefully I'm getting better with each project, but I also recognize I have a lot to learn! The more I script the more I try to create succinct, secure, elegant code with descriptive (but not too long!) comments for documentation. 

Feel free to send me any feedback you think would be helpful!
