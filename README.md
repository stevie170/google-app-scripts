# Google App Scripts

Google App Scripts is a platform that can be a powerful tool if you want to automate processes in Google Workspace (previously known as G Suite for Business). It is also available in Google Drive for users who don't use Google Workspace.

>You write code in modern JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for favorite Google Workspace applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more. There's nothing to installâ€”we give you a code editor right in your browser, and your scripts run on Google's servers.

I recently had someone tell me she wanted to populate a Google Doc template with the submission from a Google Form, using an Add-on. However, she was restricted from installing Add-ons to her Google account based on HIPAA requirements. As I researched a workaround, I stumbled on Google App Scripts and dove in to find a solution for her specific problem. As I learned, I saw the potential for so many applications and projects for someone who uses Google tools heavily and wants  automated solutions.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the scripts I wrote using learning tools, the first script I wrote for use by the friend who asked for a specific solution, plus a few more scripts I've written to automate forms for a therapy practice. I plan to add to this repository any additional Google App Scripts I write as the need arises.
