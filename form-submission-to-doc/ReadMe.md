# Form Submission to Doc

This Google App Script takes the submissions from a Form and creates a new Google Doc using the information submitted.

## Deployment

The script is attached to the responses spreadsheet for the form, and an event trigger is created to run the script each time the form is submitted.

## Customization

This script would need to be customized based on the questions and answers in the form.

Because of the needs of this particular project, this script also navigates the folders in Google Drive.
